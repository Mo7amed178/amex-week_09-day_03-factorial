# what is Factorial?

it is the product of an integer and all the integers below it;

e.g. factorial four ( 4! ) is equal to 24.
`4! = 1x2x3x4`

# what is Recursion?

Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely.
